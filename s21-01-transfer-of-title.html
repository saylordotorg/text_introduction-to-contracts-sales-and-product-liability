        <h2 class="title editable block">Why It Is Important When Title Shifts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_p01">There are three reasons why it is important when title shifts from seller to buyer—that is, when the buyer gets title.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">It Affects Whether a Sale Has Occurred</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_s01_p01">First, a sale cannot occur without a shift in title. You will recall that a sale is defined by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as a “transfer of title from seller to buyer for a price.” Thus if there is no shift of title, there is no sale. And there are several consequences to there being no sale, one of which is—concerning a merchant-seller—that no implied warranty of merchantability arises. (Again, as discussed in the previous chapter, an implied warranty provides that when a merchant-seller sells goods, the goods are suitable for the ordinary purpose for which such goods are used.) In a lease, of course, title remains with the lessor.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Creditors’ Rights</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_s02_p01">Second, title is important because it determines whether creditors may take the goods. If Creditor has a right to seize Debtor’s goods to satisfy a judgment or because the parties have a security agreement (giving Creditor the right to repossess Debtor’s goods), obviously it won’t do at all for Creditor to seize goods when Debtor doesn’t have title to them—they are somebody else’s goods, and seizing them would be conversion, a tort (the civil equivalent of a theft offense).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Insurable Interest</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s01_s03_p01">Third, title is related to who has an <strong class="emphasis bold">insurable interest</strong>. A buyer cannot legally obtain insurance unless he has an insurable interest in the goods. Without an insurable interest, the insurance contract would be an illegal gambling contract. For example, if you attempt to take out insurance on a ship with which you have no connection, hoping to recover a large sum if it sinks, the courts will construe the contract as a wager you have made with the insurance company that the ship is not seaworthy, and they will refuse to enforce it if the ship should sink and you try to collect. Thus this question arises: under the UCC, at what point does the buyer acquire an insurable interest in the goods? Certainly a person has insurable interest if she has title, but the UCC allows a person to have insurable interest with less than full title. The argument here is often between two insurance companies, each <em class="emphasis">denying</em> that its insured had insurable interest as to make it liable.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Goods Identified to the Contract</h2>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Identification Issue</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p01">The UCC at Section 2-401 provides that “title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract.” (In a lease, of course, title to the leased goods does not pass at all, only the right to possession and use for some time in return for consideration.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn18_001">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2A-103(1)(j).</span>) So identification to the contract has to happen before title can shift. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Identification to the contract</a><span class="glossdef">Segregating specific goods from the mass as the ones for the immediate contract.</span></span> here means that the seller in one way or another picks the goods to be sold out of the mass of inventory so that they can be delivered or held for the buyer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Article 67 of the CISG says the same thing: “[T]he risk does not pass to the buyer until the goods are clearly identified to the contract, whether by markings on the goods, by shipping documents, by notice given to the buyer or otherwise.”</strong></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p03">When are goods “identified”? There are two possibilities as to when identification happens.</p>
            <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Parties May Agree</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_s01_p01">Section 2-501(1) of the UCC says “identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicated agreed to by the parties.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">UCC Default Position</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_s02_p01">If the parties do not agree on when identification happens, the UCC default kicks in. Section 2-501(1) of the UCC says identification occurs</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_s02_l01" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;</li>
                    <li>if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph c., when goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise identified by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;</li>
                    <li>when crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve months after contract or for the sale of corps to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal harvest seasons after contracting, whichever is longer.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s02_s01_s02_p02">Thus if Very Fast Food Inc.’s purchasing agent looks at a new type of industrial sponge on Delta Sponge Makers’ store shelf for restaurant supplies, points to it, and says, “I’ll take it,” identification happens then, when the contract is made. But if the purchasing agent wants to purchase sponges for her fast-food restaurants, sees a sample on the shelf, and says, “I want a gross of those”—they come in boxes of one hundred each—identification won’t happen until one or the other of them chooses the gross of boxes of sponges out of the warehouse inventory.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">When Title Shifts</h2>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Parties May Agree</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p01">Assuming identification is done, when does title shift? The law begins with the premise that the agreement of the parties governs. Section 2-401(1) of the UCC says that, in general, “title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.” Many companies specify in their written agreements at what moment the title will pass; here, for example, is a clause that appears in sales contracts of Dow Chemical Company: “Title and risk of loss in all goods sold hereunder shall pass to Buyer upon Seller’s delivery to carrier at shipping point.” Thus Dow retains title to its goods only until it takes them to the carrier for transportation to the buyer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p02">Because the UCC’s default position (further discussed later in this chapter) is that title shifts when the seller has completed delivery obligations, and because the parties may agree on delivery terms, they also may, by choosing those terms, effectively agree when title shifts (again, they also can agree using any other language they want). So it is appropriate to examine some delivery terms at this juncture. There are three possibilities: shipment contracts, destination contracts, and contracts where the goods are not to be moved.</p>
            <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Shipment Contracts</h2>

The typical choices are set out in the UCC at Section 2-319:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s01_l01">

[place of shipment]</a><span class="glossdef">Seller must see goods are on board vehicle of transportation at place of shipment.</span></span> (the place from which the goods are to be shipped goes in the brackets, as in “F.O.B. Seattle”). F.O.B. means “free on board”; the seller’s obligation, according to Section 2-504 of the UCC, is to put the goods into the possession of a carrier and make a reasonable contract for their transportation, to deliver any necessary documents so the buyer can take possession, and promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.</li>

Long Beach”). F.A.S means “free alongside ship”; the seller’s obligation is to at his “expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the manner usual in that port” and to provide the buyer with pickup instructions.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn18_002">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-319(2).</span>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_p01">It is not uncommon for contracting parties to sell and buy goods stored in a grain elevator or warehouse without physical movement of the goods. There are two possibilities:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_l01">
                    <li>Goods with documents of title. A first possibility is that the ownership of the goods is manifested by a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">document of title</a><span class="glossdef">Paper representing ownership interest in goods.</span></span>—“bill of lading, dock warrant, dock receipt, warehouse receipt or order for the delivery of goods, and also any other document which in the regular course of business or financing is treated as adequately evidencing that the person in possession of it is entitled to receive, hold and dispose of the document and the goods it covers.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn18_008">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 1-201(15).</span> In that case, the UCC, Section 2-401(3)(a), says that title passes “at the time when and the place where” the documents are delivered to the buyer.</li>
                    <li>Goods without documents of title. If there is no physical transfer of the goods and no documents to exchange, then UCC, Section 2-401(3)(b), provides that “title passes at the time and place of contracting.”</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_p02">Here are examples showing how these concepts work.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_p03">Suppose the contract calls for Delta Sponge Makers to “ship the entire lot of industrial grade Sponge No. 2 by truck or rail” and that is all that the contract says about shipment. That’s a “shipment contract,” and the UCC, Section 2-401(2)(a), says that title passes to Very Fast Foods at the “time and place of shipment.” At the moment that Delta turns over the 144 cartons of 1,000 sponges each to a trucker—perhaps Easy Rider Trucking comes to pick them up at Delta’s own factory—title has passed to Very Fast Foods.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_p04">Suppose the contract calls for Delta to “deliver the sponges on June 10 at the Maple Street warehouse of Very Fast Foods Inc.” This is a destination contract, and the seller “completes his performance with respect to the physical delivery of the goods” when it pulls up to the door of the warehouse and tenders the cartons.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn18_009">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-401(2)(b).</span> “Tender” means that the party—here Delta Sponge Makers—is ready, able, and willing to perform and has notified its obligor of its readiness. When the driver of the delivery truck knocks on the warehouse door, announces that the gross of industrial grade Sponge No. 2 is ready for unloading, and asks where the warehouse foreman wants it, Delta has tendered delivery, and title passes to Very Fast Foods.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_p05">Suppose Very Fast Foods fears that the price of industrial sponges is about to soar; it wishes to acquire a large quantity long before it can use them all or even store them all. Delta does not store all of its sponges in its own plant, keeping some of them instead at Central Warehousing. Central is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bailee</a><span class="glossdef">One rightfully possessing goods not hers.</span></span>, one who has rightful possession but not title. (A parking garage often is a bailee of its customers’ cars; so is a carrier carrying a customer’s goods.) Now assume that Central has issued a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">warehouse receipt</a><span class="glossdef">A written document for items warehoused, serving as evidence of title to the stored goods.</span></span> (a document of title that provides proof of ownership of goods stored in a warehouse) to Delta and that Delta’s contract with Very Fast Foods calls for Delta to deliver “document of title at the office of First Bank” on a particular day. When the goods are not to be physically moved, that title passes to Very Fast Foods “at the time when and the place where” Delta delivers the document.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_p06">Suppose the contract did not specify physical transfer or exchange of documents for the purchase price. Instead, it said, “Seller agrees to sell all sponges stored on the north wall of its Orange Street warehouse, namely, the gross of industrial Sponge No. 2, in cartons marked B300–B444, to Buyer for a total purchase price of $14,000, payable in twelve equal monthly installments, beginning on the first of the month beginning after the signing of this agreement.” Then title passes at the time and place of contracting—that is, when Delta Sponge Makers and Very Fast Foods sign the contract.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s01_s03_p07">So, as always under the UCC, the parties may agree on the terms they want when title shifts. They can do that directly by just saying when—as in the Dow Chemical example—or they can indirectly agree when title shifts by stipulating delivery terms: shipment, destination, goods not to be moved. If they don’t stipulate, the UCC default kicks in.</p>

It says “the place for delivery is the seller’s place of business or if he has none his residence,” and delivery is accomplished at the place when the seller “put[s] and hold[s] conforming goods at the buyer’s disposition and give[s] the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn18_010">Uniform Commercial Code, Sections 2-308 and 2-503.</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch18_s01_s03_s02_p02">Title is important for three reasons: it determines whether a sale has occurred, it determines rights of creditors, and it affects who has an insurable interest. Parties may explicitly agree when title shifts, or they may agree indirectly by settling on delivery terms (because absent explicit agreement, delivery controls title passage). Delivery terms to choose from include shipment contracts, destination contracts, and delivery without the goods being moved (with or without documents of title). If nothing is said about when title shifts, and the parties have not indirectly agreed by choosing a delivery term, then title shifts when delivery obligations under the contract are complete, and if there are no delivery terms, delivery happens when the seller makes the goods available at seller’s place of business (or if seller has no place of business, goods will be made available at seller’s residence)—that’s when title shifts.</p>
