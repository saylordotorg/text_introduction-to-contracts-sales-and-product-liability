    <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_p01">Sales law deals with the sale of goods. Sales law is a special type of contract law, but the common law informs much of Article 2 of the UCC—with some differences, however. Some of the similarities and differences were discussed in previous chapters that covered common-law contracts, but a review here is appropriate, and we can refer briefly to the CISG’s treatment of similar issues.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Mutual Assent: Offer and Acceptance</h2>
        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Definiteness of the Offer</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s01_p01">The common law requires more definiteness than the UCC. Under the UCC, a contractual obligation may arise even if the agreement has <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open terms</a><span class="glossdef">Under the UCC, a term that has not been expressed in the contract.</span></span>. Under Section 2-204(3), such an agreement for sale is not voidable for indefiniteness, as in the common law, if the parties have intended to make a contract and the court can find a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. Perhaps the most important example is the open price term.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s01_p02">The open price term is covered in detail in Section 2-305. At common law, a contract that fails to specify price or a means of accurately ascertaining price will almost always fail. This is not so under the UCC provision regarding open price terms. If the contract says nothing about price, or if it permits the parties to agree on price but they fail to agree, or if it delegates the power to fix price to a third person who fails to do so, then Section 2-305(1) “plugs” the open term and decrees that the price to be awarded is a “reasonable price at the time for delivery.” When one party is permitted to fix the price, Section 2-305(2) requires that it be fixed in good faith. However, if the parties <em class="emphasis">intend</em> not to be bound unless the price is first fixed or agreed on, and it is not fixed or agreed on, then no contract results.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn17_010">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-305(4).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s01_p03">Another illustration of the open term is in regard to particulars of performance. Section 2-311(1) provides that a contract for sale of goods is not invalid just because it leaves to one of the parties the power to specify a particular means of performing. However, “any such specification must be made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.” (Performance will be covered in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch18#mayer_1.0-ch18">Chapter 18 "Title and Risk of Loss"</a>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s01_p04">The CISG (Article 14) provides the following: <strong class="emphasis bold">“A proposal for concluding a contract addressed to one or more specific persons constitutes an offer if it is sufficiently definite and indicates the intention of the offeror to be bound in case of acceptance. A proposal is sufficiently definite if it indicates the goods and expressly or implicitly fixes or makes provision for determining the quantity and the price.”</strong></p>

        <div class="section" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Acceptance Varying from Offer: Battle of the Forms</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s02_p01">The concepts of offer and acceptance are basic to any agreement, but the UCC makes a change from the common law in its treatment of an acceptance that varies from the offer (this was discussed in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch08#mayer_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Introduction to Contract Law"</a>). At common law, where the “mirror image rule” reigns, if the acceptance differs from the offer, no contract results. If that were the rule for sales contracts, with the pervasive use of form contracts—where each side’s form tends to favor that side—it would be very problematic.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s02_p02">Section 2-207 of the UCC attempts to resolve this “battle of the forms” by providing that additional terms or conditions in an acceptance operate as such unless the acceptance is conditioned on the offeror’s consent to the new or different terms. The new terms are construed as offers but are automatically incorporated in any contract between merchants for the sale of goods unless “(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer; (b) [the terms] materially alter it; or (c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.” In any case, Section 2-207 goes on like this: “Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this Act.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn17_011">This section of the UCC is one of the most confusing and fiercely litigated sections; Professor Grant Gilmore once called it a “miserable, bungled, patched-up job” and “arguably the greatest statutory mess of all time.” Mark E. Roszkowski, “Symposium on Revised Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code—Section-by-Section Analysis,” <em class="emphasis">SMU Law Review</em> 54 (Spring 2001): 927, 932, quoting Professor Grant Gilmore to Professor Robert Summers, Cornell University School of Law, September 10, 1980, in <em class="emphasis">Teaching Materials on Commercial and Consumer Law</em>, ed. Richard E. Speidel, Robert S Summers, and James J White, 3rd ed. (St. Paul, MN: West. 1981), pp. 54–55. In 2003 the UCC revisioners presented an amendment to this section in an attempt to fix Section 2-207, but no state has adopted this section’s revision.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s01_s03_p01">Under both common law and the UCC, an offer can be revoked at any time prior to acceptance unless the offeror has given the offeree an option (supported by consideration); under the UCC, an offer can be revoked at any time prior to acceptance unless a merchant gives a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">firm offer</a><span class="glossdef">A promise by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed (or “authenticated”) writing that is not revocable during the time stated or for a reasonable time not to exceed six months (UCC 2-205).</span></span>” (for which no consideration is needed).

As for international sales contracts, the CISG provides (Article 4(a)) that it “governs only the formation of the contract of sale and the rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer arising from such a contract and is not concerned with the validity of the contract or of any of its provisions.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s04_s02_p02">The CISG provides (Article 8) the following: “In determining the intent of a party or the understanding a reasonable person would have had, due consideration is to be given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices which the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties.”</p>

                <p class="para" id="mayer_1.0-ch17_s03_s04_s02_p03">The UCC modernizes and simplifies some common-law strictures. Under the UCC, the mirror image rule is abolished: an acceptance may sometimes differ from the offer, and the UCC can “plug” open terms in many cases. No consideration is required under the UCC to modify or terminate a contract or for a merchant’s “firm offer,” which makes the offer irrevocable according to its terms. The UCC has a Statute of Frauds analogous to the common law, and its parol evidence rule is similar as well. The CISG compares fairly closely to the UCC.</p>
