            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s01_p01">By agreement or stipulation, the parties may fix the time when delivery is to be made by including statements in contracts such as “Delivery is due on or before July 8” or “The first of 12 installments is due on or before July 8.” Both statements are clear.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s01_p02">If the parties do not stipulate in their contract when delivery is to occur, the UCC fills the gap. Section 2-309 of the UCC says, “The time for shipment or any other action under a contract if not provided for in this Article or agreed upon shall be a reasonable time.” And what is a “reasonable time” is addressed by comment 1 to this section:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s01_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s01_p03">It thus turns on the criteria as to “reasonable time” and on good faith and commercial standards set forth in Sections 1-202, 1-203 and 2-103. It…depends on what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in view of the nature, purposes and circumstances of the action to be taken.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s02_s02_p01">If the parties do not stipulate delivery terms or if their agreement is incomplete or merely formulaic, the UCC describes the seller’s obligations or gives meaning to the formulaic language. (Because form contracts are prevalent, formulaic language is customary.) You recall the discussion in <a class="xref" href="mayer_1.0-ch18#mayer_1.0-ch18">Chapter 18 "Title and Risk of Loss"</a> about when title shifts: we said title shifts when the seller has completed delivery obligations under the contract, and we ran through how those obligations are usually expressed. A quick review here is appropriate.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s02_s02_p02">The contract may be either a <em class="emphasis">shipment</em> contract, a <em class="emphasis">destination</em> contract, or a contract where the <em class="emphasis">goods are not to be moved</em> (being held by a bailee). In any case, unless otherwise agreed, the delivery must be at a reasonable time and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tender</a><span class="glossdef">Offer of money or performance to satisfy a debt.</span></span> (the offer to make delivery) must be kept open for a reasonable time; the buyer must furnish facilities “reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.”<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn19_002">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-503.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s02_s02_p03">In a shipment contract, the seller has four duties: (1) to deliver the goods to a carrier; (2) to deliver the goods with a reasonable contract for their transportation; (3) to deliver them with proper documentation for the buyer; and (4) to promptly notify the buyer of the shipment (UCC, Section 2-504). The contract may set out the seller’s duties using customary abbreviations, and the UCC interprets those: “F.O.B [insert place where goods are to be shipped from]” means “free on board”—the seller must see to it that the goods are loaded on the vehicle of conveyance at the place of shipment. “F.A.S. [port of shipment inserted here]” means the seller must see to it that the goods are placed along the ship on the dock ready to be loaded (Section 2-319). Price terms include “C.I.F.,” which means the sale price includes the cost of the goods, insurance, and freight charges, and “C. &amp; F.,” which means the sales price includes the cost of the goods at a cheaper unit price and freight but not insurance.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn19_003">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-320.</span> If it is clear from the contract that the seller is supposed to ship the goods (i.e., the buyer is not going to the seller’s place to get them) but not clear whether it is a shipment or a destination contract, the UCC presumes it is a shipment contract<em class="emphasis">.</em><span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn19_004">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-503(5).</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s02_s02_p04">If it is a destination contract, the seller has two duties: to get the goods to the destination at the buyer’s disposal and to provide appropriate documents of delivery.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn19_005">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-503.</span> The contract language could be “F.O.B. [place of destination inserted here],” which obligates the seller to deliver to that specific location; “ex-ship,” which obligates the seller to unload the goods from the vehicle of transportation at the agreed location (e.g., load the goods onto the dock); or it could be “no arrival, no sale,” where the seller is not liable for failure of the goods to arrive, unless she caused it.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn19_006">Uniform Commercial Code, Sections 2-319, 2-322, and 2-324.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s02_s02_p05">If the goods are in the possession of a bailee and are not to be moved—and the parties don’t stipulate otherwise—the UCC, Section 2-503 says delivery is accomplished when the seller gives the buyer a negotiable document of title, or if none, when the bailee acknowledges the buyer’s right to take the goods.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s02_s02_p06">If nothing at all is said about delivery, the place for delivery is the seller’s place of business or his residence if he has no place of business.<span class="footnote" id="mayer_1.0-fn19_007">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-308.</span></p>

An order will specify “large grade A eggs,” and that means something in the trade. Or an order might specify “20 gross 100-count boxes No. 8 × 3/8 × 32 Phillips flathead machine screws.” That is a screw with a designated diameter, length, number of threads per inch, and with a unique, cruciform head insert to take a particular kind of driver. The buyer might, for example, agree to purchase “seconds,” which are goods with some flaw, such as clothes with seams not sewed quite straight or foodstuffs past their pull date. The parties may also agree in the contract what happens if nonconforming goods are delivered, as we’ll see later in this chapter.</p>

But where circumstances permit either party to make or demand delivery in lots, Section 2-307 of the UCC permits the seller to demand payment for each lot if it is feasible to apportion the price. What if the contract calls for delivery in installment, and one installment is defective—is that a material breach of the whole contract? No. Section 2-612 of the UCC says this:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s03_s03_bl01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s04_p01">Failure to make a perfect tender, unless otherwise agreed, is a material breach of the sales contract. However, before the defaulting seller is in complete default, she has a right to cure. Here’s what the UCC says in Section 2-508:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s04_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s04_p02">(1)	Where any tender or delivery by the seller is rejected because non-conforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a conforming delivery.</p>
                <p class="para editable" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s04_p03">(2)	Where the buyer rejects a non-conforming tender which the seller had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s04_p04">Buyer orders Santa Claus candles deliverable November 5; on October 25 the goods are delivered, but they’re not right: they’re Christmas <em class="emphasis">angel</em> candles instead. But the seller still has eleven days to cure, and the buyer must allow that. Buyer places an order exactly the same as the first order, and the order arrives on November 5 in the original manufacturer’s packaging, but they’re not right. “Well,” says the seller, “I thought they’d be OK right out of the package. I’ll get the correct ones to you right away.” And the buyer would have a duty to allow that, if “right away” is a “further reasonable time.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mayer_1.0-ch19_s01_s02_s04_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Article 48 of the CISG says this:</strong></p>

If the seller requests the buyer to make known whether he will accept performance and the buyer does not comply with the request within a reasonable time, the seller may perform within the time indicated in his request.
